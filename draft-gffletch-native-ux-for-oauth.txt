                  Native User Experience for OAuth 2.0
               draft-gffletch-native-ux-for-oauth-latest

Abstract

   This specification provides trusted applications to request an
   authorization interaction that is rendered in a way that is native to
   the client.  This enables a more seamless authorization experience.

1.  Introduction

   For mobile apps the user experience can be a little jarring when
   starting the authentication/authorization flow as the user is
   transitioned from a native user experience to a browser context in
   order to login or perform other identity related functions.  This
   specification defines a mechanisms that allows a client to request an
   interaction with the Authorization server that allows for a fully
   native authorization experience.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Response Mode

   When a mobile app desires to start an authorization flow with the
   Authorization Server (AS), it specifies a new response_mode value of
   native_ux which requests the AS to return the challenge sequence in a
   descriptive language that can be interpreted and displayed in a
   native experience by the mobile app.

3.1.  native_ux

   This specification defines the response_mode value of native_ux

   native_ux  In this mode, the authorization challenge sequence,
      including consent, is managed via a domain specific language (DSL)
      with the last response containing the code and state parameters.

   The native application uses the challenges described by the DSL to
   obtain the necessary authorization credentials and complete the flow
   required by the AS.  At this point the AS returns the code and state
   parameters via the DSL and the native app completes the OAuth flow
   with the AS by submitted the required /token endpoint request.
